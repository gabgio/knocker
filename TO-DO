-- $Id: TO-DO file for knocker version 0.8.0 - released on 28 December 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
   This is the last knocker release as it is. A major rewrite in Python is 
   in progress


  Wish list for new future knocker versions:

  - Implement Stealth Scan

  - Improve the tcp connect scan by making it non blocking and scanning 
    in parallel mode.
  
  - Optimize the knocker Win32 Winsock code to be faster than the slow crap 
    it is now.
 
  - Improve the --port option to accept a list of ports, like :
    --port 22-100-1024-2025
 
  - Add an option to scan a list of hosts from a file.

  - Add an interactive mode

  - Banner grabbing.

  - Add a configuration file to deny/allow the use of knocker by normal users
    and also set color preferences.

  - Other cool things not listed yet...
